First we check if the neighbor node is better than our current node, if it we accept it and if not then we have to check different conditions firstly how much worse our current solution is and secondly how high the temperature is, at high temperatures it is more likely to accept the worse solution so I have set an initial temperature as low as possible and the step function is basically the cost function which is also initially set as 0.01 which decides the amount of time to be spent on each temperature.
